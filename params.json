{"name":"Qompoter","tagline":"Dependency manager for Qt / C++","body":"Qompoter\r\n================================\r\n\r\nAn attempt of dependency manager for Qt / C++. Because I am sick of managing each C++ piece of code separately!\r\n\r\nInspired by the well-known Composer PHP dependency manager.\r\n\r\nThe current version is still a work in progress. But still, you can:\r\n\r\n* describe in a qomposer.json file your dependencies\r\n* search and retrieve the own dependencies of your selected dependencies\r\n* retrieve all these packages from file system, or via a Git repository\r\n* compile and deploy theses packages as shared libraries\r\n* generate a vendor.pri file to include and use in your .pro file\r\n\r\nA lot have to be done to make it really usable:\r\n\r\n* compile packages as shared libraries (with a local and global version), or as source project\r\n* manage version numbers\r\n* generate better vendor.pri file (from template) to use the packages in the project\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo build this project, Qt5 is required. And you may need to update your PATH to compile in command line:\r\n\r\n    export PATH=/opt/Qt/5.3/gcc/bin:$PATH\r\n    export QTDIR=/opt/Qt/5.3/gcc\r\n\r\n    mkdir build-qompoter\r\n    cd build-qompoter\r\n    qmake ../qompoter/qompoter.pro\r\n    make\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nMake the exec file runnable, copy paste the sample qomposer.json file in your build repository:\r\n\r\n    sudo chmod u+x qompoter\r\n    cp ../qompoter/qompoter.json .\r\n\r\nand install and deploy your required dependencies easily with Qompoter:\r\n\r\n    ./qompoter install\r\n    ./qompoter make\r\n\r\nThat's it! You can now include vendor.pri in the .pro file of your project, and include the dependencies that you required:\r\n\r\n    CONFIG += solilogger chartxy\r\n    include(vendor/vendor.pri)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nDistributed under the LGPL3+ license.\r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas, critiques, suggestions or whatever you want to call it, please open an issue. I'll be happy to hear from you what you'd see in this lib. I think about all suggestions, and I try to add those that make sense.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
