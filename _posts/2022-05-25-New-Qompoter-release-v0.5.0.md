title: "New Qompoter release: v0.5.0"
date: 2022-05-25

A first release candidate v0.5.0-RC1 was published in 2021, February. It has been used without any issue. New interesting features (beta of a Debian package) and bug fixes (adaptation for Busybox) were available. It was about time to release v0.5.0!

Please, read the [release note](https://github.com/Fylhan/qompoter/releases/tag/v0.5.0) carefuly in case you were using v0.4.1. `qompoter install` action behaviour has been changed and replaced by `qompoter update`.

Thanks Louis, Alex, Jon for your contributions :D
