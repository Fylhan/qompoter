title: "[WIP] Installing one package"
date: 2017-10-03

I am currently working on providing `qompoter install vendor/packagename` to download and install or update only one package instead of all packages listed in the `qompoter.json` file. This will be particularly useful to update only one package when needed, instead of re-downloading everything!

I will let you know when this is done.
