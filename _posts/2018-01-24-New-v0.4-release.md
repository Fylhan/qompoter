I have been finishing the work on the `--save` option and some other stuffs regarding GitLab, so: it's time to release!

Please notice that this is the first v0.4.X release, it has been used in production and tested, but may still contain bugs and regressions. Previous release, v0.3.6, have received more feedback than this one and is, therefore, more stable.

The main new features and fixes of the v0.4.0 release are:

* New action: `qompoter install <packagename>` *to install or update only one package and not all packages listed in the Qompoter file*
* Feature: Improve `qompoter inspect` *to show only modified packages by default*
* Feature: Add specific library loader for GitLab forges *to download more easily GitLab CI artifacts*
* Fix: Do not erase an existing 'vendor.pri' file when a `qompoter install` fail
* Fix: Do not load sub-dependencies for library packages
* Fix: Git remote update was failing when running `qompoter export --repo` on an existing repository
