Minor bug fix release.

### Fixed

* Stable tags are now sorted before their related alpha and RC tags (e.g. v1.1.10 is now chosen instead of v1.1.10-RC1)

### Added

* Beta Debian package is added in the release (generated by resources/create-deb-package.sh). Please try it and provide feedback and be warned: I have never generated any Debian package before, this one has been made with the help of one of my colleague.


Thanks Martin for your contribution :D
