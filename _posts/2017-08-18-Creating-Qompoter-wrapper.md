title: "Creating Qompoter's wrappers"

I am currently wondering how to share the Qompoter's wrappers I have generated for some projects. The idea behind a Qompoter's wrapper is: take a project you like (e.g. [qhttp](https://github.com/azadkuh/qhttp)), create qompoter.json, qompoter.pri files for this project, and that's it, you can now easily use this project with Qompoter!

I have created a [Qompoter organization](https://github.com/qompoter) on Github for this and will provide some Qompotor's wrappers on it. Only two are available at the moment: [qhttp](https://github.com/qompoter/qhttp-wrapper) and [http-parser](https://github.com/qompoter/http-parser-wrapper).

Enjoy!
