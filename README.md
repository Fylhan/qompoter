Qompoter
================================

An attempt of dependency manager for Qt / C++. Because I am sick of managing each C++ piece of code separately!

Inspired by the well-known Composer PHP dependency manager.

The current version is still a work in progress. But still, you can:

* describe in a qomposer.json file your dependencies
* search and retrieve the own dependencies of your selected dependencies
* retrieve all these packages from file system, or via a Git repository
* compile and deploy theses packages as shared libraries
* generate a vendor.pri file to include and use in your .pro file

A lot have to be done to make it really usable.

Build
--------------------------------

To build this project, Qt5 is required. You may also need to update your PATH to compile in command line:

	export PATH=/opt/Qt/5.3/gcc/bin:$PATH
	export QTDIR=/opt/Qt/5.3/gcc

	mkdir build-qompoter && cd build-qompoter
	qmake ../qompoter/qompoter.pro
	make

Installation
--------------------------------

Make Qompoter runnable, and move it to a place accessible in the PATH:

	chmod u+x qompoter
	mv qompoter /usr/bin/qompoter

Usage
--------------------------------

In your project repository, create a qompoter.json file:

	{
		"name": "fylhan/qompoter",
		"description": "Qompoter, a dependency manager for C++/Qt.",
		"keywords": ["Qt", "C++"],
		"authors": [
			{
				"name": "Fylhan",
				"homepage": "fylhan.la-bnbox.fr"
			}
		],
		"require": {
			"trialog/solilog": "v1.0",
			"trialog/gpslib": "v1.1",
			"trialog/octavor": "v0.8",
			"trialog/qextserialport": "v1.2rc",
			"trialog/tcanp": "v1.6.7-lib"
		},
		"require-dev": {
			"trialog/autotester": "v1.0"
		}
	}

Then, download and install dependencies listed in your qompoter.json using:

	qompoter install
	qompoter make

That's it! You can now include vendor.pri in the .pro file of your project, and include the dependencies that you required:

	CONFIG += solilog chartxy
	include(vendor/vendor.pri)

Roadmap
--------------------------------

* Compile packages as shared libraries (with a local and global version), or as source project
* Manage version numbers
* Generate better vendor.pri file (from template) to use the packages in the project
* Better support and description of repositories:
	* structure
	* how to add package in it
* Forget bash and go to C++/Qt
* Better support of Git repositories
* Manage several repositories : one in local, one on Squeak, and some online (Github, ...)
* Clarify command line
* Add qompoter update: using a qompoter.lock file
* Don't copy/paste lib and headers: in vendor.pri link to existing files
* Add qompoter install --local: which copy/paste lib and headers
* Use QT += package instead of CONFIG which leverage the usage of include(vendor.pri)
* Link with inqlude
* Link with CPM (?)
* Special cases for Qt Plugins
* Better support of qompoter.json
* JSON schema for qompoter.json

Documentation
--------------------------------

### Two kinds of packages
* '''Library''': Qompoter download the library , install it locally or globally, and create an adapted vendor.pri -> you just need to use it
	* Yes but... the library compilation shall match your project: same compilator, same Qt version, same arch (32bit / 64 bit), same OS, ...
	* Still useful for company scenarii: someone build all required libraries and make them available in a private / online repositories
* '''Source files''' compiled with your projects: Qompoter download the source files and create an adapted vendor.pri -> use it and the packages will be compiled with your project

If you have any ideas, critiques, suggestions or whatever you want to call it, please open an issue. I'll be happy to hear from you what you'd see in this lib. I think about all suggestions, and I try to add those that make sense.
